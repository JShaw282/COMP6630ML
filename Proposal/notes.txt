Can we use TensorFlow?

Her link for overleaf does not work. I found the template and attempted to edit it - whenever you edit authors it does not seem to update on overleaf and can't get rid of bottom part "subbmitted to " requires more research.

See if you can figure it out. I've put the current format in here, as well as how it loads in PDF format. 

I'll look at it some more tomorrow after I study some for Forensics and perhaps try and create a timeline graph.
